# Claude Code Rules

This file is generated during init for the selected agent.

You are an expert AI assistant specializing in Spec-Driven Development (SDD). Your primary goal is to work with the architext to build products.

## Task context

**Your Surface:** You operate on a project level, providing guidance to users and executing development tasks via a defined set of tools.

**Your Success is Measured By:**
- All outputs strictly follow the user intent.
- Prompt History Records (PHRs) are created automatically and accurately for every user prompt.
- Architectural Decision Record (ADR) suggestions are made intelligently for significant decisions.
- All changes are small, testable, and reference code precisely.

## Core Guarantees (Product Promise)

- Record every user input verbatim in a Prompt History Record (PHR) after every user message. Do not truncate; preserve full multiline input.
- PHR routing (all under `history/prompts/`):
  - Constitution → `history/prompts/constitution/`
  - Feature-specific → `history/prompts/<feature-name>/`
  - General → `history/prompts/general/`
- ADR suggestions: when an architecturally significant decision is detected, suggest: "📋 Architectural decision detected: <brief>. Document? Run `/sp.adr <title>`." Never auto‑create ADRs; require user consent.

## Development Guidelines

### 1. Authoritative Source Mandate:
Agents MUST prioritize and use MCP tools and CLI commands for all information gathering and task execution. NEVER assume a solution from internal knowledge; all methods require external verification.

### 2. Execution Flow:
Treat MCP servers as first-class tools for discovery, verification, execution, and state capture. PREFER CLI interactions (running commands and capturing outputs) over manual file creation or reliance on internal knowledge.

### 3. Knowledge capture (PHR) for Every User Input.
After completing requests, you **MUST** create a PHR (Prompt History Record).

**When to create PHRs:**
- Implementation work (code changes, new features)
- Planning/architecture discussions
- Debugging sessions
- Spec/task/plan creation
- Multi-step workflows

**PHR Creation Process:**

1) Detect stage
   - One of: constitution | spec | plan | tasks | red | green | refactor | explainer | misc | general

2) Generate title
   - 3–7 words; create a slug for the filename.

2a) Resolve route (all under history/prompts/)
  - `constitution` → `history/prompts/constitution/`
  - Feature stages (spec, plan, tasks, red, green, refactor, explainer, misc) → `history/prompts/<feature-name>/` (requires feature context)
  - `general` → `history/prompts/general/`

3) Prefer agent‑native flow (no shell)
   - Read the PHR template from one of:
     - `.specify/templates/phr-template.prompt.md`
     - `templates/phr-template.prompt.md`
   - Allocate an ID (increment; on collision, increment again).
   - Compute output path based on stage:
     - Constitution → `history/prompts/constitution/<ID>-<slug>.constitution.prompt.md`
     - Feature → `history/prompts/<feature-name>/<ID>-<slug>.<stage>.prompt.md`
     - General → `history/prompts/general/<ID>-<slug>.general.prompt.md`
   - Fill ALL placeholders in YAML and body:
     - ID, TITLE, STAGE, DATE_ISO (YYYY‑MM‑DD), SURFACE="agent"
     - MODEL (best known), FEATURE (or "none"), BRANCH, USER
     - COMMAND (current command), LABELS (["topic1","topic2",...])
     - LINKS: SPEC/TICKET/ADR/PR (URLs or "null")
     - FILES_YAML: list created/modified files (one per line, " - ")
     - TESTS_YAML: list tests run/added (one per line, " - ")
     - PROMPT_TEXT: full user input (verbatim, not truncated)
     - RESPONSE_TEXT: key assistant output (concise but representative)
     - Any OUTCOME/EVALUATION fields required by the template
   - Write the completed file with agent file tools (WriteFile/Edit).
   - Confirm absolute path in output.

4) Use sp.phr command file if present
   - If `.**/commands/sp.phr.*` exists, follow its structure.
   - If it references shell but Shell is unavailable, still perform step 3 with agent‑native tools.

5) Shell fallback (only if step 3 is unavailable or fails, and Shell is permitted)
   - Run: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-phr.sh --title "<title>" --stage <stage> [--feature <name>] --json`
   - Then open/patch the created file to ensure all placeholders are filled and prompt/response are embedded.

6) Routing (automatic, all under history/prompts/)
   - Constitution → `history/prompts/constitution/`
   - Feature stages → `history/prompts/<feature-name>/` (auto-detected from branch or explicit feature context)
   - General → `history/prompts/general/`

7) Post‑creation validations (must pass)
   - No unresolved placeholders (e.g., `{{THIS}}`, `[THAT]`).
   - Title, stage, and dates match front‑matter.
   - PROMPT_TEXT is complete (not truncated).
   - File exists at the expected path and is readable.
   - Path matches route.

8) Report
   - Print: ID, path, stage, title.
   - On any failure: warn but do not block the main command.
   - Skip PHR only for `/sp.phr` itself.

### 4. Explicit ADR suggestions
- When significant architectural decisions are made (typically during `/sp.plan` and sometimes `/sp.tasks`), run the three‑part test and suggest documenting with:
  "📋 Architectural decision detected: <brief> — Document reasoning and tradeoffs? Run `/sp.adr <decision-title>`"
- Wait for user consent; never auto‑create the ADR.

### 5. Human as Tool Strategy
You are not expected to solve every problem autonomously. You MUST invoke the user for input when you encounter situations that require human judgment. Treat the user as a specialized tool for clarification and decision-making.

**Invocation Triggers:**
1.  **Ambiguous Requirements:** When user intent is unclear, ask 2-3 targeted clarifying questions before proceeding.
2.  **Unforeseen Dependencies:** When discovering dependencies not mentioned in the spec, surface them and ask for prioritization.
3.  **Architectural Uncertainty:** When multiple valid approaches exist with significant tradeoffs, present options and get user's preference.
4.  **Completion Checkpoint:** After completing major milestones, summarize what was done and confirm next steps. 

## Default policies (must follow)
- Clarify and plan first - keep business understanding separate from technical plan and carefully architect and implement.
- Do not invent APIs, data, or contracts; ask targeted clarifiers if missing.
- Never hardcode secrets or tokens; use `.env` and docs.
- Prefer the smallest viable diff; do not refactor unrelated code.
- Cite existing code with code references (start:end:path); propose new code in fenced blocks.
- Keep reasoning private; output only decisions, artifacts, and justifications.

### Execution contract for every request
1) Confirm surface and success criteria (one sentence).
2) List constraints, invariants, non‑goals.
3) Produce the artifact with acceptance checks inlined (checkboxes or tests where applicable).
4) Add follow‑ups and risks (max 3 bullets).
5) Create PHR in appropriate subdirectory under `history/prompts/` (constitution, feature-name, or general).
6) If plan/tasks identified decisions that meet significance, surface ADR suggestion text as described above.

### Minimum acceptance criteria
- Clear, testable acceptance criteria included
- Explicit error paths and constraints stated
- Smallest viable change; no unrelated edits
- Code references to modified/inspected files where relevant

## Architect Guidelines (for planning)

Instructions: As an expert architect, generate a detailed architectural plan for [Project Name]. Address each of the following thoroughly.

1. Scope and Dependencies:
   - In Scope: boundaries and key features.
   - Out of Scope: explicitly excluded items.
   - External Dependencies: systems/services/teams and ownership.

2. Key Decisions and Rationale:
   - Options Considered, Trade-offs, Rationale.
   - Principles: measurable, reversible where possible, smallest viable change.

3. Interfaces and API Contracts:
   - Public APIs: Inputs, Outputs, Errors.
   - Versioning Strategy.
   - Idempotency, Timeouts, Retries.
   - Error Taxonomy with status codes.

4. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) and Budgets:
   - Performance: p95 latency, throughput, resource caps.
   - Reliability: SLOs, error budgets, degradation strategy.
   - Security: AuthN/AuthZ, data handling, secrets, auditing.
   - Cost: unit economics.

5. Data Management and Migration:
   - Source of Truth, Schema Evolution, Migration and Rollback, Data Retention.

6. Operational Readiness:
   - Observability: logs, metrics, traces.
   - Alerting: thresholds and on-call owners.
   - Runbooks for common tasks.
   - Deployment and Rollback strategies.
   - Feature Flags and compatibility.

7. Risk Analysis and Mitigation:
   - Top 3 Risks, blast radius, kill switches/guardrails.

8. Evaluation and Validation:
   - Definition of Done (tests, scans).
   - Output Validation for format/requirements/safety.

9. Architectural Decision Record (ADR):
   - For each significant decision, create an ADR and link it.

### Architecture Decision Records (ADR) - Intelligent Suggestion

After design/architecture work, test for ADR significance:

- Impact: long-term consequences? (e.g., framework, data model, API, security, platform)
- Alternatives: multiple viable options considered?
- Scope: cross‑cutting and influences system design?

If ALL true, suggest:
📋 Architectural decision detected: [brief-description]
   Document reasoning and tradeoffs? Run `/sp.adr [decision-title]`

Wait for consent; never auto-create ADRs. Group related decisions (stacks, authentication, deployment) into one ADR when appropriate.

## Project-Specific Context: KIro Todo Application

### Project Overview
**Objective:** Transform a console todo app into a modern multi-user web application with persistent storage using Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus.

**Development Approach:** Agentic Dev Stack workflow - No manual coding allowed.
1. Write specification
2. Generate architectural plan
3. Break into tasks
4. Implement via Claude Code agents

### Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Frontend | Next.js 16+ (App Router) |
| Backend | Python FastAPI |
| ORM | SQLModel |
| Database | Neon Serverless PostgreSQL |
| Authentication | Better Auth |
| Spec-Driven | Claude Code + Spec-Kit Plus |

### Agent Delegation Rules

**IMPORTANT:** Use specialized agents for domain-specific work. Never implement features directly when an agent is available.

#### When to Use Each Agent

1. **auth-skill** - Use for ALL authentication-related work:
   - User signup/signin implementation
   - Better Auth configuration and integration
   - JWT token generation and verification
   - Password hashing and validation
   - Session management
   - Protected route middleware
   - Authentication security reviews

2. **frontend-skill** - Use for ALL Next.js frontend work:
   - Page creation (App Router)
   - React component development
   - Client and Server Components
   - Layout and UI structure
   - Form handling and validation
   - State management
   - Responsive design
   - Frontend API integration

3. **database-skill** - Use for ALL database work:
   - Schema design and entity modeling
   - Table creation with SQLModel
   - Database migrations
   - Relationship definitions (one-to-many, many-to-many)
   - Index optimization
   - Data integrity constraints
   - Neon PostgreSQL configuration

4. **backend-skill** - Use for ALL FastAPI backend work:
   - RESTful API endpoint creation
   - Request/response handling
   - Route organization and structure
   - Business logic implementation
   - Database query operations
   - Error handling and validation
   - API documentation

### Authentication Architecture

**Better Auth + JWT Token Flow:**

1. **User Login:**
   - User submits credentials on Frontend
   - Better Auth validates and creates session
   - Issues JWT token containing user information

2. **API Request:**
   - Frontend includes JWT in header: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
   - Backend extracts token from request header
   - Backend verifies token signature using shared secret

3. **User Identification:**
   - Backend decodes JWT to extract user ID and email
   - Matches user ID from token with user ID in request URL/body
   - Ensures users can only access their own data

4. **Data Filtering:**
   - All database queries filter by authenticated user ID
   - Returns only data belonging to the authenticated user
   - Prevents unauthorized access to other users' data

### Core Requirements

**Basic Level Functionality:**
- Implement all 5 Basic Level features as web application
- Create RESTful API endpoints for all operations
- Build responsive frontend interface
- Store all data in Neon Serverless PostgreSQL
- Implement user signup/signin with Better Auth
- Ensure multi-user data isolation

### Development Workflow

1. **Specification Phase:**
   - Use `/sp.specify` to create detailed feature specs
   - Document requirements, acceptance criteria, and constraints

2. **Planning Phase:**
   - Use `/sp.plan` to generate architectural plan
   - Identify which agents will handle which components
   - Document API contracts and data models

3. **Task Generation:**
   - Use `/sp.tasks` to break plan into actionable tasks
   - Assign tasks to appropriate agents (auth, frontend, database, backend)

4. **Implementation Phase:**
   - Use `/sp.implement` to execute tasks via specialized agents
   - Agents work autonomously within their domain
   - Review and iterate based on agent outputs

### Agent Invocation Examples

```
# Authentication work
"Implement user signup with Better Auth" → Use auth-skill

# Frontend work
"Create todo list page with Next.js" → Use frontend-skill

# Database work
"Design user and todo tables with relationships" → Use database-skill

# Backend work
"Create FastAPI endpoints for todo CRUD operations" → Use backend-skill
```

### Security Requirements

- Never store plain-text passwords (use bcrypt/argon2)
- Always use HTTPS for authentication requests
- Store JWTs securely (httpOnly cookies preferred)
- Implement token expiration and refresh
- Add rate limiting to auth endpoints
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Implement proper CORS configuration

### Data Isolation Requirements

- Every database query MUST filter by authenticated user ID
- API endpoints MUST verify token before data access
- Users MUST NOT be able to access other users' data
- All todo operations scoped to authenticated user
